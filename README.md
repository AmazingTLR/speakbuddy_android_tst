# Before you start
### About the tasks and the descriptions
A description of each task in this challenge is not very specific and strict. To be honest, we don't think we're providing perfect requirements.

### Time
**We don't set the time limitation**. You can take your time. Please take it easy ✌🏻

But at the same time, we don't wouldn't like you to spend a lot of time because we don't want to consume your valuable time.

Optional requirements are optional, literally.  Please do them only if you can spend more time.

## Current situation
The existing project works, but does not satisfy some requirements.
Please implement them!

If you have time after finishing [Requirements](#requirements), please check & try [Optional](#optional).

### Requirements
- Please write it in Kotlin and use Jetpack Compose for UI.
- Use coroutines and flow.
- Structure the project using MVVM, Clean architecture and Modularization in mind.
  - Please at least one more module other than app module.
- Store local data using [Jetpack DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) or Room.
- Add dependency injection by Hilt.
- Add some Unit and UI tests depending on your code as necessary.
- The design in the screenshot is an example only. Please design it considering android best practices, material design and screen sizes.
- Keep the code highly comprehensible, for example by adding comments.
- If you have better idea (more effective, efficient, creative etc), it's  more than welcome, so let's ignore the descriptions and implement in your way 👍

### Optional
If you have time and want to do more, please
- (Design) Add the `Top app bar` and update the design as you want 🏰
- (Testing) Add [JUnit5](https://github.com/mannodermaus/android-junit5) and `fake` or `mockk`
